            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="intro">Hello, my name is Mehmet. I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer with experience in automation systems.</p>
            <p>I have been involved in the design of SCADA and HMI panels and have programmed PLCs from Siemens, Hitachi, Schneider, and Phoenix using TIA Portal and Codesys. Currently, I am actively developing my skills in the mobile application development sector. My entry into the mobile app industry began during my senior year at university when I took on a project to develop a mobile app for COVID-19 testing, thanks to an academic mentor I admired.</p>
            <p>Although it has been two years since then, I have dedicated myself to developing applications for both iOS and Android platforms without interruption for the past year. I strive to master all frameworks in this field, avoiding reliance on a single one. As a result, I have developed mobile applications using Android Studio, Xcode, Flutter, and React Native.</p>
            <p>My expertise is primarily in the front-end, but I am also improving my back-end skills. Recently, I have been enhancing my knowledge in cybersecurity, as I believe the importance of cybersecurity will increase significantly in the future. Therefore, I focus on creating highly secure applications that prevent data breaches and protect usersâ€™ information. You can contact me via my social media accounts, email address, or through the contact section. Happy coding!</p>
